# Before You Start

Welcome to the Tatango API! The Tatango API is designed for developers, engineers, or anyone else who's comfortable creating custom-coded solutions or integrating with RESTful APIS. If you're not familiar with API concepts like HTTP response codes, REST endpoints, and JSON, try <a href="https://zapier.com/apps/tatango/integrations" target="_blank">Zapier</a>.

You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.

# Rate Limits

The Tatango API allows 1200 calls per hour or 1 call every 3 seconds. Please contact your account manager with your specific use case if you need a bump to this limit.

# Returning multiple results and pagination

By default, GET API calls that return multiple items in a list will return up to 10 items for a single call. The "pages_count" parameter in the returned JSON will indicate the number of "pages" included in the entire result set. (So for example, if a call to https://app.tatango.com/api/v2/lists finds 27 lists in the system, the JSON will include the following (see JSON snippet to the right):

```
   "per_page":10,
   "count":27,
   "page":1,
   "pages_count":3
```

Note that the "pages_count" parameter will default to 0 when there is no items in the list.

To fetch the next page of results, pass the "page" parameter on the URL, like this: https://app.tatango.com/api/v2/lists?page=2. You can also change the number of records returned in each "page" by passing in a "per_page" parameter as part of the URL, like this: https://app.tatango.com/api/v2/lists?per_page=50. Note that the system will only allow up to 1000 records to be returned in a single call.

# Authentication

Note: You can access your API key <a href="http://help.tatango.com/api/api-keys">here</a>.

> To authorize, use this code:

```ruby
require 'net/http'
require 'uri'

uri = URI.parse('https://app.tatango.com/api/v2/example-endpoint')
http = Net::HTTP.new(uri.host, uri.port)
request = Net:HTTP::Get.new(uri.request_url)
request.basic_auth("emailaddress@mydomain.com", "my_api_key")
response = http.request(request)
```

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct email and api key with each request
curl -u emailaddress@mydomain.com:my_api_key https://app.tatango.com/api/v2/example-endpoint
```

```javascript
var request = new XMLHttpRequest();
request.open("POST", "https://app.tatango.com/api/v2/example-endpoint", false);
request.setRequestHeader("Content-Type", "application/json");
request.setRequestHeader("Content-Type", "application/json");
request.setRequestHeader(
  "Authorization",
  "Basic " + btoa("emailaddress@mydomain.com:my_api_key")
);
request.send(null);
```

> Make sure to replace `my_api_key` with your API key, which can be obtained by logging into <a href="https://app.tatango.com/" target="_blank">https://app.tatango.com</a>.

Tatango authenticates API requests by validating an API key that must be passed with each API call. We use the built-in HTTP basic authentication scheme supported by most HTTP libraries. Use your login email as the username and the API key as the password.

# Accounts

## Get Current Account

```ruby
require 'net/http'
require 'uri'

uri = URI.parse('https://app.tatango.com/api/v2/accounts')
http = Net::HTTP.new(uri.host, uri.port)
request = Net:HTTP::Get.new(uri.request_url)
request.basic_auth("emailaddress@mydomain.com", "my_api_key")
response = http.request(request)
```

```shell
curl "https://app.tatango.com/api/v2/accounts/me" -X GET \
	-H "Accept: application/json" \
	-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
	-u emailaddress@mydomain.com:my_api_key \
	-H "Host: example.org" \
	-H "Cookie: "
```

```javascript
var request = new XMLHttpRequest();
request.open("GET", "https://app.tatango.com/api/v2/accounts/me", false);
request.setRequestHeader("Content-Type", "application/json");
request.setRequestHeader("Content-Type", "application/json");
request.setRequestHeader(
  "Authorization",
  "Basic " + btoa("emailaddress@mydomain.com:my_api_key")
);
request.send(null);
```

> The above command returns JSON structured like this:

```json
{
  "status": "OK",
  "account": {
    "id": 37,
    "email": "myemail36@gmail.com",
    "username": "boowebb36"
  }
}
```

This endpoint retrieves the current account, as specified by the API key used to authenticate.

| first_optin_message                    | This message is sent to a phone number after they've succesfully completed the single opt-in process for a specific list, and at no point in the past has been subscribed to the list.

      <em>What are the limitations for a keyword?</em>
      <p>
         <ul>
           <li>A keyword must contain at least two characters and no more than 15 characters.</li>
           <li>Keywords are not case sensitive. FOO will match foo and FOO and Foo.</li>

      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
       <em>Are keywords case sensitive?</em>
       <p>No. The system checks for duplicate keywords by transforming all keywords to uppercase before performing matching algorithms.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <em>What happens if the keyword isn't available?</em>
      <p>The response from the API will be a 422 error with the response body looking like this: {"status":"error","error":"invalid keyword names: EXISTINGKW"}</p>

    </li>
    <li>
      <em>Can I add multiple keywords to a list?</em>
      <p>Yes.  The keyword_names parameter would need to be an array, like this: {"keyword_names":["TEST","KEYWORD","NAMES"]}, of valid, not-already used, keywords.</p>

## Example Use Case

A nonprofit organization wants to track communication data in Salesforce. They log messages sent as activity records in Salesforce using the data provided by our Recipients Report. Each record from the report is logged as an activity record on each contact record in Salesforce.

In order to accurately do so they add Salesforce Contact ID (bbcrm_cons_id) as a custom field on their Tatango list and upload each subscriber's constituent ID in their initial upload.

The nonprofit organization consumes our Recipients Report on a daily basis to an AWS S3 bucket hosted by them. From there, they have a job that runs daily to pick up the .csv file, loop through each record, and create the activity records in Salesforce on each contact. This allows them to have a comprehensive view of texts that their contacts have received in Salesforce.
